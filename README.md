# Declarative Programming of Graphic Interfaces Labs

Welcome to the repository for the laboratory works completed as part of the "Declarative Programming of Graphic Interfaces" course at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute." This collection showcases a series of solutions implemented in C#.

## Overview

Each laboratory work corresponds to a specific topic covered in the "Declarative Programming of Graphic Interfaces" course. The programs are designed to demonstrate practical applications of declarative programming principles in the context of graphical user interfaces using C#.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for C# development, including a compatible IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Contribution

If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features for any of the laboratory works, please feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions from the community are highly encouraged.
